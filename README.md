# R10 - React Native Application

## Summary

R10 is a native mobile application that was built using React-Native for seamless cross-platform compatibility. 

## Languages and Tools Used

    * JavaScript
    * React & React Native
    * Redux
    * Ex-Navigator
    * Realm
    * iOS Simulator & Android Emulator


## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to gain experience with building native mobile applications using React-Rative and JavaScript.
In addition to using a multitude of React-Native components to display the UI, I also used Redux to manage the state 
of my application. To pull data from a Firebase API, I used REST endpoints, while using Realm to perform
local database operations. This app was quite challenging, but very rewarding to build. It was my first time using
React-Native to build a native mobile application, and I look forward to working with it more in the near future.
